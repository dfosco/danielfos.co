##A technological exploration of reading

---

This work brings forward a historical research around the technologies of the book throughout history and its implications for readers and their societies â€” from the dawn of writing to the development of digital reading.

It was presented as a graduation project in the Communications - Publishing major at Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro in December 2013.

Unfortunately, it is not currently available in english, but it will be translated soon, after a much needed review takes place. For those feeling adventurous, the full text in brazilian portuguese can be downloaded here as a <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/sh/jzkc2wm4thv4h9p/zzFVJpQLgz/monografia_daniel_fosco.pdf" target="_blank" alt="Monografia Daniel Fosco" title="PDF XEXELENTO">nasty PDF</a>.
